Right click and send proxy info to intercept tab
Go to intruder tab and in the tab go to positions and clear the login field and form field. Even clear the security level.
go to payloads in payload options add your password list
now go to options/settings --> scroll down till grep match (clear it), add the error message which we copied while initially logging in. ---> add it
